attack+attack/2 per week x
learn how to work with angular velocity /
get sprites and sprite sheets working x
situational animations ie attack animation
boss music
sound affects
put tails (curved lasers) on the ghost // need to learn how to use angular velocity
visual affects ei exploding/expanding bullets
backgrounds
	nonspell
	spell
mees with the player script
	change bullet spread
	lower dps
	fix the focus death glitch
make a custom border ui
	decide on a name for the bossfight

Plan of attack
nonspell 1- may rework
nonspell 2-EXPLODING BULLETS give more warning to the EXPLODING BULLETS also the warning itself looks like it will kill the player may make this spell 1 due to the gimick
spell 1 ghost (needs a tail) chases the player while they dodge coins may make it nonspell 2
spell 2 a laser draws in bullets which the player has to dodge

future gimicks
	change the width of the screen which the player can move in
	Boat....long story really it just goes across the screen and bullets trail it will need more sprites
	ghost orbitals (will need tails)
	
	
Done 1/11/2017
	attack #5
		//screen closes in on the player and they have to dodge a stream of bulets akin to the player
		UI background
			//was needed so the screen closeing in didnt leave a black box
			//to do this I had to make custom system files 
				//in terms of what changed I swap out the default img ui and made a task for a border to appear around the play area it even folows the play area as it shrinks
			//created graphics for a background in the play area my goal is to find a away to when I render it basicaly use one of the layers as a cliping mask I'm out of ideas on how to do it tho
			//the need for this is that I want each layer to move idavidually I may just use a cheaper simpler option using opacity and swaping out a part scrolling with just animating it using sprites
	
	new goals
	
	get sounds affects working

		sort of finished the background never got the whole clipping mask to work but it doesnt break and looks decent
		slight chnages to timing and health for all attacks
		
		goal 
			attack animations
			new attack
				plan
					sense the screen is already shrunk shortened or whatever I might as well use it for more attacks
					however my plan with it is to have the screen slowly close in on the player until they have literally no space to dodge
					given the amount of scrren space left I will need to make another attack the resets the screen size
					fix the 3 spell when I change the screen size I made it so the charecters arent really affected but the players projectiles are
					given that the next time I use that the boss will be attacking while the boss fires
					
					pattern
						I have used far to many rng based patterns
						now I have yet to use that many spirit based projectiles which the char I'm basing this boss on is known for
						given that I plan to use or finally give the ghosts a tail

	remade attack pattern for third spell
		now uses sin or cos cant remember which to make a alternating wave to use for bullet placement they are then aimed thorugh progression of that sin or sos equation
		also added exploding bullets to it
		came up with a semi fix to placement issues when shrinking the stg frame
			when I shrink th screen it changes each side by 6 so to keep a object in a relatively same spot I just -6 however for some reason it gets moved off this bad as there is a laser that is fired then more for just special affects and if you hug it that gittering can kill
			also I plan to have a spell be that the boss attacks as the screen shrinks and use its constant closeing in as a timer for the player so I need a soloution
			SOULOUtion sort of.. I tied the boss's and laser's x value to the middle of the screen keeping them in line with no gittering still a issue for the player and thir shots
		used a visual affects library to show charing only in 3rd spell and 2 nonspell right now
most of the same goals as last time are still in place at least every thing that has yet to be done.... also I have far to many files for the background....

1/24/2017
	remade the spell 2 still a wip
		bullets now not heavilly aimed at the player or really at all
			used co and sin one or the other to make a waving stream of bullets the come out from the bottom of the laser on both sides so left and right and the are pulled to the laser
			set it up so there are no annoying sudden direction turns
			theres a pair of bullets each not countting the ones on the opposite side one is purple the other blue
			the blue bullets stop at the laser
				I used objshotsetdelay to do this so i can keep its trajectory afterwards
				the delay function hides a bullet weel at least its sprite... removes the hitbox and stops it as well as creating a aura of the bullets color
				this is usally used to signal where bullets are going to come from in this case the aura will make the laser glow even more.
1/25/2017
	finished remaking spell 2 no really changes but there were some additions so i guess thats still a change
		added bullets that come from the side and get destroyed on the laser
			uses sin/cos placment and slight alternations to the equation to get a tragectory
			its rather hard but I like it
		add boss movement using what else but sin/cos... that stuff is really usefull for this
			stops to charge and shot the laser
				 really it stops so the particle affect for the chare doesnt go to a empty space...
	Next target is spell 1 I want to finally add the tail for the ghost
		I plan to revamp the genral pattern of the bullets that the player has to dodge
			it already has a sort of second attack.. that being it shoots out a second string of bullets after a delay
	plan
		as of know I dont know theres a few to many easy path ways and I need to decide whether i give the boss movent wich will affect the bullet pattern
		
discoverd how to add or make after images in other words tails using stellar effects
	I found it by inputing the wronng information int paremeters
	it also uses very little processing power
	the specific command was emitter
		it seems to have at least with what I got a sort of firey or burning affect to it it does work for ghosts or spirits tho
	I plan to apply it in most places with spirit type projectiles except for nonspell 2 and yes all those exploding bullets are spirits 
	and sense I'm already running low on processing power in that attack as is I dont plan to add more visuall affects till I fix it
		
side note I really should make it clear what tasks or functions were added... I may do it but in case I dont finish that in time you may be able to just use a diff checker

also sense I dont believe I ever really talked about my goal for this concerning difficulty and as of writing this I'm out of ideas on how to revamp attacks I might as well share my goal
	sufice to say my hope is to make a bullet hell game based on the touhou franchise that series is known for its difficulty so dont expect the final product to be forgiving
	I'm going to mostlikely make it only a boss fight later in the year I may make it into a whole stage
		which would mean power progression non boss fodder enimies and a mid boss
	as it stand I'm basing the boss off of a specific charecter and I'm basing her attacks on the gimmick she had in the games she has appeared in
		the main ones of note are that she throw coins... LOTS of coins, controls spirits and can control length and distance

2/3/2017
	updated nonspell2
		this was the one with exploding bullets it had lag so I was looking to rework it to cut down what ever was casuing the lag I have yet to really find it
		tho I have shortened the distance from the screen that a object can be before it is deleted this helped the frame rate there was also a large safe spot where the exploding bullets could not get to
		I fixed that
		I redid the basic spread as well as after 2 loops a sceond much denser spread that will likely go off once
			considering when this fires the player will have to dodge them while the primed explosive bulletts (which can kill as well) are out so they will be a little stressed
	updated	nonspell1
		I did somethings with this... I have no clue what I am going to do with this attack really I plan to have the final be un aimed and not random the execption being the cureving splitting ghots bullets
	Goal
		finish reworking nonspell1
			not aimed decent gaps between bullets boss doesnt move
		start spell5
			I have it as spell 5 cause I plan to make a spell 4 if this sort of test goes well
				the test is that I want a spellcard where the walls close in on the play area but i cant mess with the stg frame to do this as it changes the cordanites
				so I plan to make fake walls using sprites and give them a sort of collision so the player cant move through them... so they are technically walls I guess
					I have to figure out the colision part when it comes to the sprite I plan to just take sections from the ui background to make it.
		add sound affects
			find a sound affect library I like that doesnt have static
		mess with the pause screen files
			change the options to english
			add the 'r' restart keyboard shortcut
		make more animations
		adjust time on attacks and boss health for attacks
			I want to get 2-3 cycles in for the bosses attacks I may speed them up to do this
2/15/2017
	created and finished spell 4
		I found a way to make fake walls(its still part of the rendering area thats used for gameplay) using sprites taken from the ui background
			the walls wil slowly close in on the player giving them less move to room
			this happens as the boss is also attacking which is why this is deferent from spell 3
				BUG-the player can clip into the walls for a second and are then pushed out I have yet to come up with a solution for this
					I'm using 2 different meathods of stopping the players movement but neither worked perfectly
					at the moment tho it allows the player a chance to survive if they are stuck between the edge of the screen and some bullets
			through out the attack I have bullets in a wave like formation traveling down the screen to make the play area represent a river.. again
				this uses a cos or sin that changes really quickly so as not to make it not random also the starting value is based on the players angle to the boss
			I have two different coin based attacks in this which switch after a given amount of times
				the  first one is a spread to cover the screen when it is still wide
					this one isnt that wasnt that hard after I learned its pattern... tho it may take a while for the player to learn this
				the second has coins bounce off the ever closing in walls
					its the same angle but aimed at opposite walls so theres a decent amount of safe space
					the main threat is that the player may waste time waiting for a set of those bullets to pass which can be deadly
						I have yet to beat this without losing a life tho it is possible.. I just made to many mistakes when I was trying to beat it
			I have more spirit bullets cause why not
				they travel down screen in a fake random pattern why snaking from side to side there is a cap of how many can be on screen at once
				when they first spawn a big one will appear this one is much lrger and slower(I had plans to use these more but do to limited screen space decided against it)
					all the spirit bullets can push the coins which can either help the player by making semi safe spaces(you still have to deal with the spirit bullet)
					or mess with them
						I'm rather proud of my soloution for how exactly one would do this so if you want to find the lines of code quick 
						here is somehing you can command F to get to them fast "spiritPush"
				I also found ways to cut down how processor intensive the trails those bullets leave are
	I did something else in another attack I think dont remember what.. you should be able to tell in github
	Goals
		sound
			background music
				likely going to "borrow" something just to test if I actually release this I plan to either make a bgm for it 
				or get a ok from the artist of whatever song I decide would be a good fit
			sound affects
				the player script I'm using(which is not my own) has basic sounds for firing dieing and bomb(screen clears aka get out of jail free cards)
				the death sound is needed to give good feed back so the player doesnt feel like they had a cheap death(I have learned this first hand through testing)
				need to get sound affets for the boos firing bullets
					sound affects needed
						sound affects for coins two variation
						sound affects for spirit bullets two variation
						explosion sound affect for exploding bullets in non spell 2 and spell 3
						ignition sound affect for exploding bullets in non spell 2
						sound affect for exploding bullets stoping in spell 3
						sound affect for river starting spell 3 and spell 4
							possibly sound affects for bullets colliding in spell 4 may get annoying tho
				will require a meathod for having sound affects play but not over lap to a horrible degree
		remake nonspell 1
			still not happy with it... dont have a plan for it right now
				in the time bieng I may not include it in the bossfight ie the plural script
		more visual affects or just visual improvements
			rework the background a bit
				I may try again to get the whole clipping mask thing to work
		make nonspell 3 to go in between spell 3 and spell 4
		fix player script
			theres some bugs in the player script I'm using I would like to edit other aspects of that script as well
		FAR OFF Goals
			make this a stage
				learn how to do stage scripts
				make enemies and items (point items and power which raise player dps)
				make lead up to boss
